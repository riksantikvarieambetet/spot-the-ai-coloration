          <p>One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.</p>

          <p>Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws, and began to think.</p>

          <p>First of all he said to himself: That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee. </p>
